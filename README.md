# Mexican American ancestry research 
This code is from our manuscript "Recent shifts in the genomic ancestry of Mexican Americans may alter the genetic architecture of biomedical traits." The data used for our analysis was accessed through dbGaP Study Accession phs000810.v1.p1. This code assumes you already have the data and the majority of the code recreates figures and tables. 

The code for the simulations on ancestry over time as mentioned in "Simualting ancestry proportions over time" in the results section of the paper is labeled as sim_ancestry_proportions.r
