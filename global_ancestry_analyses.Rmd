The following describes the analyses discussed within the global ancestry analyses of the paper. This includes Figures 1-2, Table 1, Supplementary Figures 1-6 and Supplementay Table 1. The HCHS/SOL data can be accessed itself through dbGaP Study Accession phs000810.v1.p1. HRS data for Supplementary Figure 5 was made available under IRB Study No. A11-E91-13B.

#####Reading in the admixture run file, subsetting the reference pops, extracting admixed samples 
```{r}
#Read in the admixture file estimates file 
HCHS_SOL_admixture_file<-read.table("/Users/melissaspear/Dropbox/HCHS_SOL/HCHS_SOL_clean_set_with_Reich_NAM_CEU_YRI_hg19_FINAL_030718_forwardstrand_PRUNED.3.Q", header =F, sep = ' ')
names(HCHS_SOL_admixture_file) <- c("YRI","CEU","AI")

#Reading in the fam file accompaniment of the .bed file called for the admixture run 
fam_file = read.table("/Users/melissaspear/Dropbox/HCHS_SOL/HCHS_SOL_clean_set_with_Reich_NAM_CEU_YRI_hg19_FINAL_030718_forwardstrand_PRUNED.fam", header=F, sep = ' ')
fam_file_with_IDs <- cbind(fam_file, HCHS_SOL_admixture_file)

CEU<-fam_file_with_IDs[1:104,] #subset the CEU ref pop
YRI<-fam_file_with_IDs[105:211,] #subset the YRI ref pop
AI<-fam_file_with_IDs[212:323,] #subset the AI ref pop 

all_ref<-rbind(CEU,YRI,AI)

#Extracting out only the 95% admixed samples
admixed_95<-fam_file_with_IDs[which(fam_file_with_IDs$CEU <= 0.95 & fam_file_with_IDs$YRI <=0.95 & fam_file_with_IDs$AI <=0.95),]

dim(admixed_95)
```

##### Reading in the HCHS/SOL phenotype files and merging with the global ancestry estimates 
```{r}
#Read in the HCHS/SOL phenotype file 
HCHS_SOL_pheno<-read.table("/Users/melissaspear/Dropbox/HCHS_SOL/HCHS_SOL_allphenotypes_ALL_samples_new_birthyear.txt", header= T, sep = '\t')

#merge the admixed 95 indivudals with the pheno file 
admixed_with_pheno<-merge(admixed_95, HCHS_SOL_pheno, by.x =c("V1"), by.y=c("SUBJECT_ID"))
dim(admixed_with_pheno)
```

#####Subsetting the HCHS/SOL populations 
```{r}
#Dominican subset 
Dominican<-admixed_with_pheno[which(admixed_with_pheno$BKGRD1_C7 == "0"),]
dim(Dominican)
```

```{r}
#Central American subset
Central_American<-admixed_with_pheno[which(admixed_with_pheno$BKGRD1_C7 == "1"),]
dim(Central_American)
```

```{r}
#Cuban subset
Cuban<-admixed_with_pheno[which(admixed_with_pheno$BKGRD1_C7 == "2"),]
dim(Cuban)
```

```{r}
#Mexican subset 
Mexican<-admixed_with_pheno[which(admixed_with_pheno$BKGRD1_C7 == "3"),]
dim(Mexican)
```

```{r}
#Puerto Rican subset 
Puerto_Rican<-admixed_with_pheno[which(admixed_with_pheno$BKGRD1_C7 == "4"),]
dim(Puerto_Rican)
```

```{r}
#South American subset 
South_American<-admixed_with_pheno[which(admixed_with_pheno$BKGRD1_C7 == "5"),]
dim(South_American)
```

```{r}
#Mixed/Other samples
mixed_other<-admixed_with_pheno[which(admixed_with_pheno$BKGRD1_C7 == '6'),]
dim(mixed_other)
```

#N=nrow(d)
```{r setup, include=FALSE}

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
